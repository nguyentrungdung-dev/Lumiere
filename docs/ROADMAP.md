2. **Code Quality**
   - Follow `/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` religiously
   - Write clean, modular, and typed code
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **Testing**
   - Test each endpoint with sample data
   - Validate frontend forms properly
   - Handle edge cases and errors

4. **Documentation**
   - Update API_SPEC.md as endpoints are built
   - Document any deviations from plan
   - Keep README updated
