## 🤖 AI/LLM Integration

### **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Integration**

#### **Features**:
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (fast and cost-effective)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (deterministic outputs)
- **Response Format**: JSON mode for structured outputs
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0 - 1.0 based on LLM certainty

#### **SQL Generation Prompt**:
The LLM receives:
1. **Table Schema**: Column names and types
2. **Sample Data**: First 3-5 rows
3. **User Question**: Natural language query
4. **Constraints**: pandasql-compatible SQL rules

#### **Prompt Engineering Rules**:
- Use "data" as table name
- Match column names exactly (case-sensitive)
- Standard SQL only (no CTEs, no window functions)
- Always use GROUP BY for aggregations
- Keep queries simple and efficient

---

## 📊 SQL Execution with Pandasql

### **How It Works**:
1. Load CSV data into pandas DataFrame
2. Execute SQL query using `pandasql.sqldf()`
3. Convert results back to JSON format
4. Handle numpy type conversions
5. Measure execution time

### **Supported SQL Features**:
- ✅ SELECT, FROM, WHERE
- ✅ GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- ✅ Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- ✅ JOINs (if multiple data sources)
- ✅ HAVING clause
- ❌ CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- ❌ Window functions

---

## 💾 Query History Storage

### **Database Table**: `queries`

**Stored Information**:
- User ID
- Data source ID
- Question (original NL query)
- Generated SQL
- Execution status (success/error/pending)
- Result row count
- Execution time (ms)
- Error message (if failed)
- Timestamps

---

## 🛡️ Features Implemented

### **1. Natural Language Processing**
- Convert plain English to SQL
- Context-aware query generation
- Schema-informed suggestions
- Confidence scoring

### **2. Query Execution**
- Execute SQL on CSV data
- Fast execution with pandas
- Type conversion handling
- Error handling and reporting

### **3. Query Management**
- Store query history
- Retrieve past queries
- Re-run previous queries
- Delete unwanted queries
- Filter by data source

### **4. Error Handling**
- Invalid SQL detection
- Data source not found
- Execution failures
- LLM API errors
- Type conversion errors

## 🧪 Testing Flow

### **Complete Test Workflow**:

1. **Login** - Get access token
2. **Upload CSV** - Upload test data (`test_sales_data.csv`)
3. **Execute AI Query** - Ask a natural language question
   - Example: "What were the top 3 products by sales?"
4. **View Results** - See generated SQL and results
5. **Get Query History** - See all past queries
6. **Re-run Query** - Execute same query again
7. **Delete Query** - Clean up history

### **Sample Questions to Test**:
```
- "What were the total sales by region?"
- "Show me the top 5 products by revenue"
- "What was the average price per category?"
- "How many sales were from wholesale customers?"
- "Which region had the lowest sales?"
```

---

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Sales Analysis**
**Question**: *"What were the total sales by region in January?"*

**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) as total_sales 
FROM data 
WHERE Date LIKE '2024-01%' 
GROUP BY Region 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
```

---

### **Use Case 2: Product Performance**
**Question**: *"Which product had the highest average price?"*

**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SELECT Product, AVG(Price) as avg_price 
FROM data 
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY avg_price DESC 
LIMIT 1
```

---

### **Use Case 3: Customer Segmentation**
**Question**: *"How many sales were from retail vs wholesale?"*

**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SELECT Customer_Type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM data 
GROUP BY Customer_Type
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 2.4 - 2.5)

According to the ROADMAP, next tasks are:

### **Phase 2.4: Chart Generation** ⬅️ NEXT
- [ ] POST `/ai/chart` - Generate chart config from query results
- [ ] Chart.js compatible configuration
- [ ] Automatic chart type selection

### **Phase 2.5: Insight Generation**
- [ ] POST `/ai/insight` - Generate textual insights
- [ ] Summarization using LLM
- [ ] Business-focused recommendations

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Critical for good SQL generation
2. **Pandasql**: Great for running SQL on DataFrames
3. **Type Conversion**: Numpy types need conversion for JSON
4. **Error Handling**: LLM can generate invalid SQL, need validation
5. **Context**: Providing schema and sample data improves accuracy

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No CTEs**: Pandasql doesn't support Common Table Expressions
2. **No Window Functions**: Not supported in pandasql
3. **Results Not Cached**: Full results not stored (only metadata)
4. **OpenAI Dependency**: Requires API key and internet connection
5. **Single Table**: Currently works with one CSV file at a time
